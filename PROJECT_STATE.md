# HMS QR Product Manager — Current State

Current Stage: STAGE_5_UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM_PENPOT_UICANVAS
Current WP: QC + NG return + packing + delivery status
Current Revision: R007
Current Branch: main
Current Verdict: PASS_STAGE5_UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM_LIGHT_INDUSTRIAL_R007C_INTEGRATED

Stage progress: Stage 0 PASS; Stage 1 PASS; Stage 2 PASS; Stage 3 PASS; Stage 4 PASS; Stage 5 UI design system integrated locally; next-stage scope frozen.

Design system: canonical light industrial tokens in `apps/design_tokens.py`. Penpot is the intended canonical visual design authority and UICanvas is the intended local rapid-prototype canvas. Open Design 0.19.0 remains optional historical tooling only; its paid AMR generation run is retired and is not retried.
Desktop redesign: shared PySide6 token theme applied to Product Master and Tracking.
Mobile redesign: existing operational flow retained with semantic CSS token layers,
focus states, and 44px touch-safe controls.
Visual evidence: Penpot exports plus external desktop captures at 1280x720 and
1920x1080; mobile runtime was checked at 360/390/414/768 with no horizontal
overflow and no browser console errors.
Regression results: `40 passed, 1 warning` in 92.18s with controlled external
pytest temp root; warning is external Starlette/httpx deprecation.

Latest completed work: typed event-based QC/shortage/NG-rework/packing/delivery/
general-report workflows anchored to Tracking Item, atomic status projection,
active-revision quantity aggregates, semantic idempotency, structured APIs,
desktop actions/history, mobile QC/GIAO HÀNG mode and fresh R006A review.

Next exact action: separately authorize NAS storage + Product images/attachments
+ backup foundation + exact Excel template preparation. Do not start it inside
R006A without new authority.

the exact next recovery gates.

R007B5 recovery evidence:

```text
UICANVAS_NODE24_EXIT_CODE=0
UICANVAS_NODE24_PORT3200=FALSE
UICANVAS_NODE22_VERSION=v22.23.2
UICANVAS_NODE22_EXIT_CODE=0
UICANVAS_NODE22_PORT3200=FALSE
PENPOT_NPM_PACKAGE=@penpot/mcp@2.15.4
PENPOT_NPM_INSTALL=BLOCKED_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS_esbuild_sharp
PENPOT_MCP_PROCESS=NOT_STARTED
PENPOT_PLUGIN_SERVER=NOT_STARTED
```

The official UICanvas checkout behaves identically under Node 24 and the
portable official Node 22 control, so the Node-version hypothesis is rejected.
The official Penpot npm fast-path resolves correctly but its pnpm bootstrap
stops before server startup because native build scripts are refused by the
host policy. No config mutation or PASS claim was made.

R007B6 source-sparse recovery evidence:

```text
PENPOT_RELEASE=2.17.0

```

Penpot's free web UI is at the standard login screen; authentication was not
automated. UICanvas's existing VS Code host opened the extension view, but a
Windows Defender Firewall prompt blocked confirmation of its dynamic HTTP
listener. No security prompt was automated or changed.

R007B7C dual-identity recovery and HMS QR canonical design evidence:

```text
PENPOT_MODE=OFFICIAL_REMOTE_MCP
PENPOT_STAGE72_MCP_RECOGNIZED=PASS
PENPOT_HMS_QR_MCP_RECOGNIZED=PASS
PENPOT_STAGE72_TOOL_COUNT=4
PENPOT_HMS_QR_TOOL_COUNT=4
PENPOT_TWO_PROJECT_PARALLEL_ISOLATION=PASS
PENPOT_HMS_QR_READ_TEST=PASS
PENPOT_HMS_QR_WRITE_TEST=PASS
PENPOT_HMS_QR_READBACK=PASS
PENPOT_DUAL_PROJECT_PARALLEL_GATE=PASS
PENPOT_ARTIFACT_A=PASS
PENPOT_ARTIFACT_B=PASS
PENPOT_ARTIFACT_C=PASS
PENPOT_ARTIFACT_D=PASS
PENPOT_ARTIFACT_E=PASS
PENPOT_ARTIFACT_F=PASS
PENPOT_ARTIFACT_G=PASS
PENPOT_TOKEN_IN_REPOSITORY=NO
```

The protected Stage72 file was read before and after the HMS QR disposable
write and remained unchanged. The runtime UI received bounded token alignment:
Tracking now applies the shared PySide6 theme and Mobile layers semantic CSS
variables/touch-safe controls over the existing workflow markup. No domain,
API, or QR contract was changed. Fresh Alembic smoke passed and the full suite
returned `40 passed, 1 warning` in 85.70s; test isolation, secret scan, and
diff check pass. The candidate is ready for review and remains unmerged.

R007B7D canonical visual direction override:

```text
CANONICAL_THEME=LIGHT
DESKTOP_LIGHT_THEME_REVIEW=PASS
MOBILE_LIGHT_THEME_REVIEW=PASS
PENPOT_LIGHT_ARTIFACT_REFRESH=PASS
```

The user superseded dark-mode-first wording. Semantic tokens, PySide6 theme,
Web CSS variables, Penpot Design System, and A–G artifacts now use the light
industrial direction. Desktop and Mobile light-theme reviews have passed using
fresh runtime captures and responsive browser checks.

R007C independent review and local integration:

QR_LABEL_PAYLOAD_SEPARATION=PASS
PENPOT_SECRET_MATCH_COUNT=0
POST_INTEGRATION_VERIFICATION=PASS
STAGE5_LOCAL_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE_PUSH_PENDING
```

R007C used read-only Penpot inspection for the HMS QR identity and the
sanitized dual-project ledger. The protected Stage72 identity was not live at
review time, so no Stage72 write, delete, or rename was attempted; its prior
sanitized mapping remains the protection evidence. The in-app browser exposed
the current runtime viewport only; responsive acceptance combines source/CSS
review, computed light-runtime checks, and the retained bounded target-width
evidence without inventing a screenshot.

Next-stage freeze: NAS STORAGE + PRODUCT IMAGES / ATTACHMENTS + BACKUP
FOUNDATION + EXACT EXCEL TEMPLATE PREPARATION. No next-stage implementation was
started under R007C.
